Class work
For twenty-four year I was a stay at home mother and wife. Then divorce caused me to consider what I would do for a career with very little work experience. I enrolled in college to begin working towards a bachelor's degree in information technology-software. I have not yet finished my degree due to some setbacks. I am currently working toward a web foundations certification at my local community college. Then my goal will be to re-enroll at WGU to finish my bachelor's degree in information technology-software. 

Check back here often to see my work. Let's see how I improve over the course of the next couple of years. Go girl power!!
